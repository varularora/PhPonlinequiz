<li>In a binary tree a node can have maximum two children, or in other words we can say a node can have 0,1, or 2 children.

Properties of binary tree.
<br>
1) The maximum number of nodes on any level i is 2i where i>=0.<br>

2) The maximum number of nodes possible in a binary tree of height h is 2h-1.<br>

3) The minimum number of nodes possible in a binary tree of height h is equal to h.<br>

4) If a binary tree contains n nodes then its maximum possible height is n and minimum height possible is log2 (n+1).
<br>
5) If n is the total no of nodes and e is the total no of edges then e=n-1.The tree must be non-empty binary tree.<br>

6) If n0 is the number of nodes with no child and n2 is the number of nodes with 2 children, then n0=n2+1.</li><br> 
<li> malloc()

This function allocates memory dynamically. It is generally used as:

ptr= (datatype *) malloc(specified size);

Here ptr is a pointer of type datatype ( can be int, float, double….) and specified size is the size in bytes. The expression (datatype *) is used to typecast the pointer returned by malloc().</li><br>
<li>The calloc() function is used to allocate multiple blocks of memory.</li><br>
<li>Memory is one of the most important resources and it is limited. The dynamically allocated memory is not automatically released; it will exist till the end of program. So it is programmer’s responsibility to free the memory after completion. The free() function is used to release the memory that is allocated at run time.</li><br>
<li>A linear data structure traverses the data elements sequentially, in which only one data element can directly be reached</li><br>
<li>An array is a set of homogeneous elements. Every element is referred by an index.  
Arrays are used for storing the data until the application expires in the main memory of the computer system. So that, the elements can be accessed at any time</li><br>
<li>A Queue refers to a sequential organization of data. 
- It is a FIFO type data structure in which an element is always inserted at the last position and any element is always removed from the first position.</li><br>
