<li>C++ is created by Bjarne Stroustrup of AT&T Bell Labs as an extension of C, C++ is an object-oriented computer language used in the development of enterprise and commercial applications.</li><br>
<li>The wrapping up of data and functions into a single unit (called class) is known as encapsulation. Encapsulation containing and hiding information about an object, such as internal data structures and code.</li><br>
<li>Polymorphism means one name, multiple forms. It allows us to have more than one function with the same name in a program. It allows us to have overloading of operators so that an operation can exhibit different behaviors in different instances.</li><br>
<li>A constructor is a member function with the same name as its class. The constructor is invoked whenever an object of its associated class is created.It is called constructor because it constructs the values of data members of the class.</li><br>
<li>Constructor which initializes it's object member variables with another object of the same class. If you don't implement one in your class then compiler implements one automatically.</li><br>
<li>A destructor is called for a class object when that object passes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.A destructors as the name implies is used to destroy the objects that have been created by a constructors. </li><br>
<li>A Constructor with no arguments or all the arguments has default values called default constructor.</li><br>
